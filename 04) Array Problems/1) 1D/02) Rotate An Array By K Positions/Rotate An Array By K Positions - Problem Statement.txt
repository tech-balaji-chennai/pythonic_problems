Rotate An Array By K Positions - Problem Statement

Implement the function arrayRotate(int[] arr, int n, int k) which takes two arguments

arr[] - array
n     - size of the array
k     - no of positions to rotate an array

Your task is to rotate the given array by k positions.

Example:

input 1: 
n = 5
arr[] = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 1
output 1: 
[5,1,2,3,4]

input 2: 
n = 5
arr[] = [1,2,3,4,5]
k = 2
output 2:
