Prime Number - 01 - Problem Statement

1) Description:
You will be given a number 'N'. Your task is to find whether given number is Prime Number Or Not (Primality Test).

2) Specification (I/O Format):

i) Input Format:
A single integer num

ii) Output Format:
Display the string for the given input
Display "Prime Number" if num is a prime number
Display "Not Prime Number" if num is not a prime number

3) Example (Sample Test Cases):

i) Sample Input 1:
 5
ii) Sample Output 1:
 Prime Number

i) Sample Input 2:
 4
ii) Sample Output 2:
 Not Prime Number

4) Definition:
A Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Factors of num = {1, N}, so it is a prime number.
If not, then it is a composite number
It belongs to the Prime series prime(N) = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,...,N (Using Formula: prime(N) = (N) not % (2 to N-1))
Generate Prime series for given number and compare given number with Nth Prime number in the Prime series
Using Trial Division Method: To check divisibility of any number from 2 to sqrt(N)
