Fibonacci Number - 01 - Problem Statement

1) Description:
You will be given a number 'N'. Your task is to find whether given number is Fibonacci Number Or Not.

2) Specification (I/O Format):

i) Input Format:
A single integer num

ii) Output Format:
Display the string for the given input
Display "Fibonacci Number" if num is a fibonacci number
Display "Not Fibonacci Number" if num is not a fibonacci number

3) Example (Sample Test Cases):

i) Sample Input 1:
 5
ii) Sample Output 1:
 Fibonacci Number

i) Sample Input 2:
 4
ii) Sample Output 2:
 Not Fibonacci Number

4) Definition:
A Fibonacci number is a number which is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers.
It belongs to the Fibonacci series fib(N) = 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,...,N (Using Formula: fib(N) = fib(N-1) + fib(N-2))
Generate Fibonacci series for given number and compare given number with Nth Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci series
Using Formula: A number is a Fibonacci number if any 1 of the following equations must be a perfect square (derived from Binet's Fibonacci Formula):
i) 5N**2 + 4
ii) 5N**2 - 4
Ex: N = 5
i) 5(5)**2 + 4 = 5(25) + 4 = 125 + 4 = 129 (perfect square since sqrt(129) = 11.3578 is not an integer)
ii) 5(5)**2 - 4 = 5(25) - 4 = 125 - 4 = 121 (perfect square since sqrt(121) = 11 is an integer)
Since 2nd equation is true, 5 is a Fibonacci number
