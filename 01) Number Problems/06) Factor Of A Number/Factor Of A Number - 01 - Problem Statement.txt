Factor Of A Number - 01 - Problem Statement

1) Description:
You will be given 2 numbers 'num_1', 'num_2'. Your task is to find whether the given number is Factor of Number

2) Specification (I/O Format):

i) Input Format:
First line contains a single integer num_1
Second line contains a single integer num_2

ii) Output Format:
Display the string for the given input
Display "Factor" if num_2 is a factor of num_1
Display "Not Factor" if num_2 is not a factor of num_1

3) Example (Sample Test Cases):

i) Sample Input 1:
 10
 2
ii) Sample Output 1:
 Factor

i) Sample Input 2:
 10
 3
ii) Sample Output 2:
 Not Factor

4) Definition:
Factor of a number is a number (divisor) which divides that number (dividend) completely without any remainder (remainder = 0)
Using Formula: Factor = (num_1) mod (num_2) = 0
Dividend = (Divisor * Quotient) + Remainder
Note: num_1 is dividend, num_2 is divisor (if it is factor)
Using Divisibility Rule Method: Divisibility Rule (or) Test checks (or) tests whether a number (dividend) is divisible by another number (factor) without performing full division
It has a table that describes the properties of factors by dealing with the digits of that number
Initially, we can use factors from 1 to 60 for simplicity
