Display Hello World - 03 - Solution Approach

1) Logic:
Display the string "Hello World" to the output (screen) using a built-in output statement (print(), System.out.println(), document.Write(), printf(), cout<<)

2) Technique (Algorithm):
Trivial Algorithm (Or) Printing Algorithm

3) Data Structure:
- (just prints string literal)

4) Edge Cases And Constraints:
- (since there is no input (or) logic that could vary, there are no edge cases to handle)

5) Time And Space Complexity:

i) Time Complexity:
O(1)

ii) Space Complexity:
O(1)
