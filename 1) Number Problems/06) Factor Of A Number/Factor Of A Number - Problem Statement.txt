Factor Of A Number - Problem Statement

Problem Statement:
You will be given 2 numbers 'num_1', 'num_2'. Your task is to find whether the given number is Factor of Number

Example:

input 1: 
 10
 2
output 1: 
 Factor

input 2: 
 10
 3
output 2: 
 Not Factor 

Definition:
Factor of a number is a number (divisor) which divides that number (dividend) completely without any remainder (remainder = 0)
Using Formula: Factor = (num_1) mod (num_2) = 0
Dividend = (Divisor * Quotient) + Remainder
Note: num_1 is dividend, num_2 is divisor (if it is factor)
Using Divisibility Rule Method: Divisibility Rule (or) Test checks (or) tests whether a number (dividend) is divisible by another number (factor) without performing full division
It has a table that describes the properties of factors by dealing with the digits of that number
Initially, we can use factors from 1 to 60 for simplicity
